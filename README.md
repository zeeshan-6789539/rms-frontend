## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs on **:5001** and expects the RMS backend on **:5000**:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

That URL is the backend host plus its global prefix (`API_PREFIX=api`) and URI version
(`API_VERSION=1`). The backend must allow `http://localhost:5001` in its `CORS_ORIGINS`.

Scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `typecheck`.

## Super admin flow

`/companies` and `/users` are super_admin-only on the backend, and the UI mirrors that:
the sidebar hides both links for other roles, and each page is wrapped in
[`RequireRole`](src/components/layout/require-role.tsx), which reads `GET /auth/me`.

Both screens follow the same shape, matching the backend's list contract — paginated,
searchable, newest first:

- debounced search, plus filters (status; role and company on users),
- a create/edit dialog validated with Zod schemas that mirror the backend DTOs, so the
  common mistakes are caught before a request goes out,
- deactivate/reactivate through a confirm dialog. `DELETE` is a soft delete: it flips
  `status` to false and `PATCH /:id/restore` flips it back, so rows are never lost.

Backend rules the forms reflect: a `super_admin` cannot belong to a company, a company
cannot be deactivated while it still has active users, and passwords cannot be changed
through `PATCH /users/:id` — `UpdateUserDto` omits the field, so the edit dialog does not
offer it.

The dashboard reads its counters from the same list endpoints (`meta.totalItems` with
`limit=1`), so no extra backend route is needed.

## Language switching

Locale lives in the URL (`/en/...`, `/ur/...`) and is resolved by [src/proxy.ts](src/proxy.ts).
`<html lang dir>` is set per request, and Urdu loads Noto Nastaliq Urdu automatically.

Use logical CSS properties (`ms-*`, `me-*`, `ps-*`, `pe-*`, `text-start`, `text-end`) so
layouts mirror correctly in RTL.

Add a locale by extending `locales` in [src/i18n/routing.ts](src/i18n/routing.ts) and adding a
matching file in [messages/](messages/); mark it RTL in [src/utils/direction.ts](src/utils/direction.ts).

## Theming

Colours are OKLCH custom properties in [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css): `:root` for
light, `.dark` for dark, exposed to Tailwind via `@theme inline`. Use semantic classes
(`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`) rather than raw palette values.

## Data fetching

Every call goes through the shared Axios instance in
[src/lib/api-client.ts](src/lib/api-client.ts), which:

- prefixes `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`,
- attaches `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` from the session cookie,
- unwraps the backend `{ success, message, data, error }` envelope so callers receive `data`,
- normalises every failure into `IApiError` (`status`, `code`, `message`, `details`),
- on a `401`, refreshes once through `/auth/refresh` and replays the request; concurrent
  401s share a single refresh call. If the refresh fails, the session is cleared and the
  user is sent to the login page.

Feature slices own their fetchers, query keys and hooks — see
[src/features/auth/](src/features/auth/). Query keys are centralised per feature
(`authKeys`) so invalidation stays predictable.

Server components may still prefetch into a per-request `QueryClient` and pass it through
`HydrationBoundary`; client hooks then read the hydrated cache without a second request.

## Auth

`POST /auth/login` returns a token pair plus the user. Tokens are stored in the
`rms_access_token` / `rms_refresh_token` cookies (see
[src/lib/auth-session.ts](src/lib/auth-session.ts)) so that
[src/proxy.ts](src/proxy.ts) can guard routes at the edge: an anonymous request to any
route is redirected to `/{locale}/login`, and a signed-in request to the login page is
redirected back to `/{locale}`.

Cookies are written client-side and are therefore readable by JavaScript. If the backend
later sets `httpOnly` cookies itself, drop `auth-session.ts` and read the cookie names
directly in the proxy.

Route names and cookie names live in [src/config/auth.ts](src/config/auth.ts).
